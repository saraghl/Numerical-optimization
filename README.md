# Numerical-optimization
This repository contains my coursework and final project for a graduate-level Numerical Optimization course. It includes implementations and numerical experiments involving steepest descent, Newton’s method, hybrid optimization strategies, line search methods (Armijo and Wolfe conditions), adaptive step-size schemes, and convergence-rate analysis.

The final project focuses on a systematic optimization study of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), comparing gradient estimation methods, optimizers (GD, Momentum, Adam, Quantum Natural Gradient), and step-size strategies on a transverse-field Ising model.
