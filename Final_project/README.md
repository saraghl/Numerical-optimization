This project presents a systematic numerical study of classical optimization strategies in the context of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), a hybrid quantum–classical algorithm for computing ground-state energies on near-term quantum devices. The focus is on understanding how optimization choices affect convergence speed, accuracy, robustness, and computational cost.

Using a transverse-field Ising model as a benchmark, the project compares different gradient estimation techniques (finite-difference and parameter-shift rules), optimization algorithms (gradient descent, momentum, Adam, and quantum natural gradient), and step-size strategies (constant and decaying schedules). Performance is evaluated through convergence trajectories, final energy error relative to exact solutions, robustness across random initializations, and total energy evaluation cost.

The results highlight trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency, showing that optimizer design and step-size strategy often have a larger impact on performance than gradient precision alone. This project demonstrates the importance of numerical optimization techniques in variational quantum algorithms and provides practical guidance for selecting optimization methods under realistic computational constraints.
